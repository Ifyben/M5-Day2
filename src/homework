## You are in charge of creating a set of WebAPIs for the Strive Blog application.

## Here you can find the Frontend already created

 

## In this first "step" the application should enable the creation, editing, deletion, listing of blog authors.

 

## Tomorrow you will connect to your backend from the frontend that we provided and communicate with your own API.

 

 

## Authors should have the following information:

 

## name
## surname
## ID (Unique and server-generated)
## email
## date of birth
## avatar (e.g. https://ui-avatars.com/api/?name=John+Doe)
 

## The backend should include the following routes:

 

## GET /authors => returns the list of authors
## GET /authors/123 => returns a single author
## POST /authors => create a new author
## PUT /authors/123 => edit the author with the given id
## DELETE /authors/123 => delete the author with the given id
